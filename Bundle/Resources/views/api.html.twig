This Api provide highlighter service for the multiples libraries
including Pygments, Geshi, Highlight and two web services

It's designed to provide syntax highlighting for web applications
that don't have an highlighter library installed.

You'll receive highlighted HTML back, which you can store for later
display on your site.
You can style the pygmentized HTML using CSS like this:
